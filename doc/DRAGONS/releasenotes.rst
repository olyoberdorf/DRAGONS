V2.1.0
======
This is the first public release of DRAGONS.  This release offers support
for the science reduction of all current Gemini facility imagers: GMOS, NIRI,
GSAOI, and Flamingos-2.  GNIRS keyhole image reduction is also supported in a
limited way.

This software can be used to reduce Gemini imaging data instead of the
Gemini IRAF package.

This release does not include support for spectroscopy data.

Installation instructions can be found in the Recipe System User Manual at:
